qstr_You_came_into_this_w|You came into this world as {reg59?daughter:son} of a declining family of influence.

qstr_a_travelling_merchan|a travelling merchant
qstr_You_were_always_movi|You were always moving from one place to another seeking to make a profit.

qstr_an_outlaw|an outlaw
qstr_Your_education_was_r|Your education was rather informal. Living in abandoned huts or even along the road, you were put to work begging until you became more useful for cutting purses.

Serving the more senior members of the household, your first lessons were in humility. In compensation, there were all sorts of entertainments: chess games, gossip, bards visiting to recite the poems of great deeds and loves. You were drawn most by the world of conflict and competition. You played rough games with other children, batting each other with sticks as swords. Such games provided you invaluable lessons for your current life.
qstr_a_craftsman_s_appren|a craftsman's apprentice
qstr_Your_parents_sent_yo|Your parents sent you to learn a trade. After years of hard work and study under your new master, he promoted you first to journeyman and finally to fully paid craftsman for as long as you wished to stay. You became adept with tools and crafting.

qstr_Formerly_being_a_sla|Formerly, being a slave,
qstr_your_adult_life_was_|your adult life was full of misery. Forced to do all the hard menial tasks for your owners, you grew to be thick-skinned, fast, and strong. Sometimes your masters gave you no food, and so you had to learn to forage in the wild in order to satisfy your hunger. Your world was small and monotonous, the days seemed to be always the same. Rain and sun punished your body during these endless working days. From sunrise to sunset, with your back aching all the time, your only reward was to see another day, although some of your fellow sufferers were not so lucky. When you got some free time -- something that rarely happened -- you practiced hurling stones with a simple sling. You can hit a dried gourd some paces distant and cause it to explode with a satisfying CRACK.
qstr_Formerly_you_were_a_|Formerly, you were a priest.
qstr_When_you_were_not_wo|When you were not working or studying at the monastery, you traveled around spreading the word of God. Anyone who listened to you was greatly impressed with the passion of your sermons. Though you had kept the vow of poverty through all those itinerant years, you never lacked for food, drink or shelter, as the hospitality of the peasants was particularly generous toward a rising {reg59?woman:man} of God. Now and then, the villagers came to the monastery to purchase the unique products that you made.^^Healing is another of your abilities. Your skill mended many a broken bone and kept many a soul in its body instead of venturing into God's hands. Full of faith, you feel safe outside the thick monastery walls. You are armed with nothing more than a rod or a staff, symbols of the divine ones that comfort you.

qstr_Formerly_you_were_a_p|Formerly, you were a poacher.
qstr_Unsatisfied_with_com|Unsatisfied with common men's desperate desire of wealth, you took to your local lord's own forests and helped yourself to their bounty, laws be damned. You hunted stags, boars and geese and sold their meat under the table. You cut down trees right under the watchmen's noses and turned them into firewood to warm many a freezing home during harsh winters. You found that honor is easy enough to barter away for a few hard-to-find silvers. When the hard times came, you foraged for food and became an expert at finding edible plants in the wild.
qstr_Formerly_you_were_a_f|Formerly, you were a free {reg59?woman:man}, and moreover {reg59?mistress:master} over a bit of land.

You owned some servants who helped you with the hard work, but since your husband didn't own a lot of land, you still had to do a variety of tasks that all peasants wives have to do. Your husband had to pay rent to his overlord and owed him labour services in exchange for the land given. When he was involved in a war your husband answered his call as a foot soldier. Then he had to rely on his shield and spear in the thick of battle.

qstr_My_name_is_Beda_The_|My name is Beda The Old, and if you delve into this world, I recommend you listen carefully...^^Britain. The Britons call her Ynys Prydein, the Goidels call her Alba while the Angles and Saxons gave the name of Englaland to the lands they conquered. These islands are large, rich and beautiful... and are coveted. So the land is currently at war and respects only the law of the sword and spear. Realms are born and killed off, and kings die on the battlefield. Women are widowed, and horses carry arms instead of hay. The shouts of warriors fill the air, and the earth lies barren from the trampling of armies. As in past eras of strife, mortal enemies rise, equipped in armour. Ravens are calling, wolves are howling, spears clash and shields answer.^^In the north, the kingdoms of the Angles crumble before the advance of the Danes. The sons of the notorious Viking lord Ragnar, the new lords of these lands, now rule Bernacia, Deira and Elmet, the land known as Northhymbre.^^In the south, the Saxons of West Seaxe, led by the Brytenwalda Aethelred and his brother Aelfred, prepare for war. They know that on the other side of the sea, more Danes prepare to cross the ocean in search of fame and wealth.^^Pushed into the remote fringes of their native land by centuries of landward invasion, the native Britons now are threatened by Vikings on their coasts. They fight desperately not to lose what little they have left, dreaming of a king to unify them all and lead them to final victory -- a new King Arthur. The reality is that their equitable inheritance laws keeps the holdings of each lord small and unity harder to achieve. Nevertheless, one strongman, Rhodri the Great of Gwynedd, has begun to impose his will over the rest of Wales.^^In the lands of the far north, Norwegian invaders thirty years ago wiped out the old competing Gaelic and Pict aristocracies in one fatal blow at a chance three-way battle. After this disaster, Gaelic strongman Cinead McAlpin started to forge a new kingdom out of the two peoples, but they have been driven to the highland center of their former territories.^^Across the sea, in Ireland, Aed 'Fair Warrior' mac Niall of Aileach has emerged as high king in Temair after overcoming his enemies, but it is nothing more than a prestigious title. His claim is never accepted by the other half of the Ui Neill, and the fighting for land, women and cattle, in the sort of fratricidal wars endemic to that land, continues unabated. Meanwhile, both Danes and Norwegian Vikings have established dozens of coastal strongholds and use the rivers to plunder the Goidelic hinterland, but they are all too prone to join the native conflict -- on all sides.^^^The world is chaos, and chaos is war.

qstr_You_are_in_Kingdom_o|You are in Kingdom of DANMARK.^^Danmark is the most important Norse state of the Viking Age. The Danes not only maintain their independence against the powerful Frankish empire but also attack and plunder towns, churches and monasteries throughout Western Europe.Danish Vikings are excellent merchants who traded with most of their known world. A strong central authority has been established in Jutland, and the Danes begin to look beyond their own territory for land, trade and plunder. While the men were out at sea, the management of the farm was under the control of the women.
qstr_You_are_in_Kingdom_of|You are in Kingdom of NORTHVEGR.^^In Northvegr mountainous terrain and fjords formed strong natural boundaries, communities remain independent of each other and thirty small kingdoms exist in this country.The largest chieftains of the petty kingdoms have started a major power struggle. The sea was the easiest way of communication between the Norwegian kingdoms and the outside world, and the people become traders and explorers as well as plunderers.The lack of suitable farming land force Norwegians to travel to the sparsely populated islands of the Northern Sea to colonize.The early Viking raids to Britain were carried out by Norwegians but later the Danes joined in.
qstr_You_are_in_Kingdom_of_|You are in Kingdom of LAITHLIND.^^Laithlind is the Norse-dominated part of Scotland and the Northern Islands, conquered by the Vikings some decades ago.The Laithlinds attack frequently the Picts of Alban and so this kingdom has become an operating base for the Norwegian expansion in the British Isles.        On the other hand, internal strifes between the king's sons to get the throne are common.
qstr_You_are_in_Kingdom_of_F|You are in Kingdom of FRIESE.^^Friese is region along the southeastern coast of the North Sea, the homeland of the Frisians, a people closely related to the Anglo-Saxons by language.The Frisian realm has its centre of power in the city of Utrecht and is an important trading region that extends from the north of Frankia to the border of Denmark.The Frisians lost their independence after being defeated by the Franks long time ago, but now their country is under the rule of the danish.
qstr_You_are_in_Kingdom_of_W|You are in Kingdom of WEST SEAXE.^^West Seaxe is the kingdom of the West Saxons in the south of Britain. Some decades ago, king Egbert conquered Mierce and secured his overlordship from the king of Northhymbre.He thereby became the Brytenwalda, or high king of Britain, but this position of dominance was short-lived, although the expansion of West Seaxe across south-eastern England proved permanent.Egbert's later years saw the beginning of the Viking raids on West Seaxe. The Danes were decisively crushed by Egbert's son and successor King Aethelwulf in the Battle of Aclea. This victory postponed Danish conquests in England for fifteen years, but raids on West Seaxe continued.Aethelwulf was succeeded by each of his four surviving sons ruling one after another: Aethelbald, Ethelbert, Aethelred and finally Alfred the Great.
qstr_You_are_in_Kingdom_of_E|You are in Kingdom of EAST ENGLE.^^The kingdom of East Engle was a small independent Anglian kingdom in eastern extreme of Britain, settled by the Anglo-Saxons earlier than many other British regions.It was ruled by the Wuffingas dynasty, but fell to Mierce. The Vikings ravaged East Engle but in the latter year the Saxons defeated them in two great battles.There then followed a relatively peaceful period in which the Vikings attacked only once. However the Danes eventually stopped raiding and settled permanently in East Engle.
qstr_You_are_in_Kingdom_of_M|You are in Kingdom of MIERCE.^^Mierce is one of the most powerful kingdoms of the Anglo-Saxons, centered on the valley of the River Trent and its tributaries.It originally composed the border areas Midlands that lay between the districts of Anglo-Saxon settlement and the Celtic tribes they had driven to the west.The kingdom's capital is Tamworth, which was the seat of the Mercian Kings. For 300 years having annexed or gained submissions from five of the other six Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, Mercia dominated the Anglo-Saxon realms in a period known as The Mercian Supremacy.However, after the invasions of The Great Heathen Army, a great part of the Mercian territory was absorbed into the Danelaw.
qstr_You_are_in_Kingdom_of_N|You are in Kingdom of NORTHHYMBRE.^^Northhymbre is Anglian kingdom of the northern Anglo-Saxon territory. It extended from the south of Alban to the north of the river Humber.It was originally composed of the union of the kingdoms of Bernicia and Deira, but later incorporated Gododdin lands northwards and gradually extended westward, encroaching on the Celtic realms.Afterwards Northhymbre became part of the Danelaw, after its conquest by the brothers Halfdan Ragnarsson and Ivar the Boneless who installed an Anglo-Saxon nobleman, Ecgberht, as a puppet king.
qstr_You_are_in_Kingdom_of_G|You are in Kingdom of GWYNEDD.^^The kingdom of Gwynedd was one of the successor states which emerged during the fall of the Roman Empire and the arrival of the Saxons to Britain. Based in northwest Wales, the rulers of Gwynedd were acclaimed as 'King of the Britons' before losing their power in civil wars and invasions.The Welsh of Gwynedd remained conscious of their Romano-British heritage and their kings tried to link their rule with the old imperial Roman order with the use of Latin in writing and sustaining the Christian religion.Roman knowledge however is mainly lost and the Britons of Gwynedd shifted towards a militaristic tribal society.
qstr_You_are_in_Kingdom_of_B|You are in Kingdom of BRYCHEINIOG.^^Brycheiniog was a small independent kingdom in South Wales. It often acted as a buffer state between England to the east and the powerful Welsh realms to the west.The kingdom of Brycheiniog was probably founded by Irish raiders, very likely the Ui Liathain, whose power had grown great in Wales until they were reduced by the sons of Cunedda.
qstr_You_are_in_Kingdom_of_A|You are in Kingdom of ALT CLUT.^^Alt Clut is one of the kingdoms of the Britons located in the north of the Anglo-Saxon realms and in the south of Alban.It emerged after the fall of Roman Empire with its capital in the town of Alt Clut. The Britons of Alt Clut defeated the men of Dal Riata while the Picts attack three times this kingdom unsuccessfully.After this, an alliance of the Picts and Northumbrians laid siege Alt Clut and the city was captured several years later. However, 18 years ago the men of Alt Clut were able to burn the Pictish city of Dunblane.
qstr_You_are_in_Kingdom_of_C|You are in Kingdom of CORNUBIA.^^The kingdom of Cornubia is settled in a peninsula from the south-east of Great Britain bordered to the north and west by the Celtic Sea and to the south by the English Channel.Cornubia was the home of the Celtic tribe known as the Cornovii, separated from the Britons of Wales after the Battle of Deorham, often in war with the expanding Saxon kingdom of West Seaxe.Brythonic language and culture was apparently shared by Britons trading across both sides of the Channel, and tin mining is important in the Cornish economy.
qstr_You_are_in_Kingdom_of_GL|You are in Kingdom of GLYWYSSING.^^The small Celtic kingdom of Glywyssing was founded out of a western chunk of the former Silures by Eugenius, the son of High King Magnus Maximus.This was the most Romanised area of Wales, although they were descended from the Iron Age tribe of the Silures. Glywyssing is said to be named after Glywys, a legendary early monarch.
qstr_You_are_in_Kingdom_of_U|You are in Kingdom of ULADH.^^The Uladh are a Gaelic people of Ireland who gave their name to the kingdom located in the north of the island, the homeland of the Ulaid and the Cruithne tribes.The Ui Neill dynasty, descendants of Niall of the Nine Hostages, displaced the Uladh and dominated Ulster from their base in Tir Eoghain.
qstr_You_are_in_Kingdom_of_L|You are in Kingdom of LAIGIN.^^Situated in the east of Ireland, the tribes of Laigin were united by Ugaine Mor, the first historical king of Laigin, who built the hill-fort of Dun Ailinne. When the Roman legions left Britain, the people from Laigin settled in North Wales.For a long time the rule of Laigin was disputed by two dynasties, the Ui Dunlainge and the Ui Cheinnselaig, but finally the first one got the control of the crown. 19 years ago, a Norse army was defeated at Sciath Nechtain by Lorcan mac Cellaig of Laigin and Olchobar mac Cinaeda of Mumain.
qstr_You_are_in_Kingdom_of_MU|You are in Kingdom of MUMAIN.^^Situated in the south of Ireland, the kingdom of Mumain is ruled by the Eoganachta dynasty. 19 years ago, after multiple defeats for the Norsemen, Olchobar joined forces with his eastern neighbour, Lorcan mac Cellaig, King of Laigin, to defeat a Viking army at Sciath Nechtain.Two hundred Vikings were killed, later ones increase the number of dead, among them one Tomrair, jarl of the king of Laithlind.
qstr_You_are_in_Kingdom_of_CO|You are in Kingdom of CONNACHTA.^^Connachta is an Irish kingdom situated in the west of the island. Conn of the Hundred Battles, a legendary king of Ireland, was progenitor of the later ruling Connachta tribes and the namesake for the kingdom of Connacht.Some centuries later, the ancient line of Connacht kings was displaced by the midland rulers, whose centre was at Tara.Two members of this Tara dynasty, Brion and Fiachra, founded clans, the Ui Briuin and the Ui Fiachrach, to which all the rulers of Connaught belonged. Conchobar mac Taidg Mor is now the King of Connacht from the Ui Briuin branch of the Connachta. A Norse raid through Connacht on their way to Limerick but they were ambushed and defeated by the Connachtmen.

qstr_You_are_in_Kingdom_of_MI|You are in Kingdom of MIDE.^^Mide means 'middle', due this kingdom lay in the middle of Ireland. It was created by Tuathal Teachtmhar which, having subdued the rulers of the other kingdoms, created his own realm from lands he annexed from the other four based around the Hill of Tara.Niall of the Nine Hostages established himself as king of Tara and almost without interruption his descendants were considered among the highest kings of Ireland for six centuries.His son Loegaire succeeded him and welcomed St. Patrick to his court. Niall's sons and grandsons continued a conquest of the northern Laigin territories to carve out the sub-kingdoms of Mide and Brega for their descendants.
qstr_You_are_in_Kingdom_of_AL|You are in Kingdom of ALBAN.^^In the North of Breat Britain, Picts and Scots, with their own separate languages, were traditional enemies. However, a semblance of unity among these peoples arrived thanks to the efforts of Kenneth MacAlpin, King of Dal Riata, who claimed the throne of the Picts after he had defeated them in battle.He created the kingdom of Alban with its capital at Forteviot, in Pictish territory, and moved his religious center to Dunkeld where he transferred the remains of St. Columba from Iona.

qstr_My_name_is_Beda_the_|My name is Beda the Old, and this is my chronicle of what happened in the times in which I lived...
qstr_They_weren_t_good_ti|They weren't good times. In Anno Domini 861, my master, Bishop Swithunus, died. Before he died, he told me that the end of time was coming.^^In 865 a pagan army attacked Cent. Men from Cent managed to placate them, but under the pretence of peace and the lure of money, the invaders pillaged the country nevertheless.^^Later that year, in East Anglia, a large pagan army made winter quarters. The following summer, King Eadmund, eager to see them off, quickly horsed them. This was no raiding party; it became known as the Great Heathen Army. Thousands of men, led by the sons of Ragnar, had come to stay.^^In 867, the end of time started, as Swithunus had predicted. The Great Heathen Army of Danes went over the mouth of the river Humbre to Eoferwic. They captured the town, and there was an immense slaughter of the Northumbrians. Both kings, Osbert and Aella, were slain. So now the Danish rule the north, imposing their laws and pagan ways... Where is God when you need him?^^In the south, the Friese coast was being devastated by Vikings. Merchant ships fled north, seeking the protection of West Seaxe.^^In Ireland and Wales, the pagans were becoming more powerful each day. Many said that the Dal Riata and land of the Picts would soon be no more...
qstr_BEDA_CHRONICLE^^{s2}^|BEDA CHRONICLE^^{s2}^^{s3}
qstr_The_news_coming_from|The news coming from the north was disturbing. Ragnar's sons were calling men to advance on Mercia. It was still a great army; nonetheless reinforcements from Danmark were expected. God protect us.
qstr_Some_merchants_repor|Some merchants report that Sigurd 'Snake in the Eye' is bringing warriors on hundreds of boats. I overheard some of the king's advisers in Witan Ceaster saying that the Danish want to destroy all the kingdoms of Englaland.^^The only good news I heard was when a messenger informed us that some Danish sent by Jarl Sigurd, Ragnar's son in Danmark, to attack Friese were defeated in Doccinga.^^That was the first time I heard the name of {playername}, who had led the defense of Doccinga.^^Little did I know then that he was going to be an important figure in my life.
qstr_There_was_a_man_call|There was a man called Egbert, or I should say a king, Egbert Cyning, for he was king of Northhymbre. But he was a puppet king, chosen by the Vikings because he was a weak man whom they could handle. Was this the fate that awaited us also?
qstr_In_Anno_Domini_868_t|In Anno Domini 868 the Vikings took Snotingaham. There was fear, much fear, but West Seaxe and Mierce joined forces. Aelfred of West Seaxe, the king's brother, was married to Ealswith, daughter of Aethelred Mucel, ealdorman of the Gaini, and of Eadburh, from the royal line of the king of the Mercians.^^The two realms called the fyrd to war. West Seaxe advanced on Snotingaham from the south, and Mierce joined them on the way. Maybe they could finally put an end to the advance of the sons of Ragnar?^^My life was about to change, but I did not know that.
qstr_I_still_dream_of_Dou|I still dream of Douar-an-Enez when I close my eyes. No man of God should allow such dreams -- it was as if the devil had escaped from prison and taken over the world.
qstr_I_remember_sailing_i|I remember sailing into battle and vomiting several times. My hands were shaking and a painful chill overlaid my spine. I was no warrior, but my fate laid with {playername} and {reg59?her:his} men.If we were defeated, would die with the rest. Fortunately, by some miracle of God, I survived. Too many did not, including Bodo, with whom, I hear, {playername} had shared long time since they met on a ship called the Woden Ric.I figured Bodo would be a great loss for {reg59?her:him} after everything that had happened, but {reg59?her:his} face was imperturbable, and no one dared to ask how {reg59?she:he} felt.^^After the two battles of Douar-an-Enez, we spent a few weeks in the remains of the village, healing the wounded, burying the dead, and recovering all of the past. I really think that this time was when my work was most needed. Many came to me for comfort and to thank me for all my words over the dead.^^Then we sailed back to Englaland, where, we didn't yet know, that the world had changed...
qstr_Maybe_part_of_him_is|Maybe part of him is left in the baby that he had with Thora, daughter of Ulf from Danmark. The boy, named after his father, grows strong and healthy, and promises to be a powerful man someday.
qstr_My_name_is_Beda_and_|My name is Beda, and this book started as a chronicle of a dark time, but the time is not so dreadful, as it was overshadowed by a hero.
qstr_I_was_there_when_the|I was there when the armies of the Saxons and Danes fought at Aescendun. I was there when {playername} changed the course of history. But even this and what happened next pales in importance when the world lost its hero. I remember it like it just happened, when we entered the hall and watched as Sven Bull Neck finished off {playername}'s mother. I remember {reg59?her:his} face. It became ice cold. Neither anger nor fear nor crying; only coldness. I assure you that Sven Bull Neck turned pale because he knew that his death was inevitable. We fought in the hall and Sven died, but that did not change the hardness of the face of {playername}. Neither then nor later, at the funeral of {reg59?her:his} mother, revered like a queen, and buried with rich grave goods in a warship.^^After that day, we lost our hero. {reg59?She:He} said farewell to us, who we had followed {reg59?her:him} from battle to battle, and said {reg59?she:he} was leaving without revealing {reg59?her:his} destination.^^{reg59?She:He} left us, I fear, to never return. I hope I am wrong, because this dark world still stands in need of {reg59?her:his} exploits.

qstr_^^The_fate_of_Donnac|^^The fate of Donnachdh was dark. He returned to Alban, where he recruited a crew of Scots to pillage the Norwegian merchants in the Sea of Hibernia. The Norwegians of Dubh Linn put a price on his head, gave chase and killed him in a epic battle that the bards still sing about at the court of Alban.
qstr_^^Morgant_returned_t|^^Morgant returned to Cornubia and sought to unite the clans to try to recover the territory of the old kingdom of Dunmonia, but was unsuccessful. Many were simply abandoning their homeland for the other side of the channel, which amazingly enough failed to reduce the many rivalries. In the end, he gave up and retired to the monastery of Petrockstow, where I know he took vows.
qstr_^^Dwywei_was_one_of_|^^Dwywei was one of the few who did not give up after the departure of {playername}, and I know she left in pursuit of him. She loved him despite all that happened, and was willing to travel the world to find him. I don't know if she was successful or if she is even still alive.
qstr_^^Dwywei_despite_all|^^Dwywei, despite all the past, never resigned herself to the departure of {playername}. I heard she left in pursuit of him.
qstr_^^Reginhard_returned|^^Reginhard returned to Dorestad where he married Adda, the shopkeeper, and they had a son named Thiaderd. Their marriage was a happy one, but it didn't last. The latest news say that, tormented by his double betrayal, first of Thiaderd and then of {playername}, he returned to his vice.

She returned to Danmark, where she hunted and killed all the brothers of Sven, along with their families. The Thing sentenced her to death, so now she's hiding somewhere among other bandits and exiles.
qstr_^^The_loeknir_the_ph|^^The loeknir, the physican, Asbjorn returned to Odinsve, the home of his parents, weary of war. He puts his knowledge to use helping cure people, all for just a few penings -- even free to anyone who asks. His fame runs throughout the north, and people worship him like a saint.
qstr_^^Helgi_was_very_fon|^^Helgi was very fond of {playername}, despite all the past, and when she left, he plunged into a terrible depression. The last thing I know is that he went back east and became a Rus, hoping more blood would soothe his grief.
qstr_^^Helgi_became_depre|^^Helgi became depressed after the departure of {playername}. Without clear direction, he marched east and became a Rus, looking for his fate in unending war.
qstr_^^The_Greek_Agathino|^^The Greek, Agathinos, stayed in the north, near Lundenwic. There he got a job rebuilding the old Roman infrastructure. Sometimes I get letters from him. I do not know why we were never friends, but he likes to keep up the relations he made in his past, and I must be the only remnant of another time he has left.
qstr_^^And_that_is_all_wh|^^And that is all what I know about people who served under {playername}.
qstr_After_the_departure_|After the departure of our leader, we, {reg59?her:his} followers, dispersed to the four winds. I hid in a monastery in a remote part of West Seaxe, far from it all. Here I will wait for the end of my days. I pay people to bring me news from outside, especially if they find {playername}, but nobody has seen {reg59?her:him}. However, I've got some little news from others who were with him until the end.

I know only a bit, but I think the jarl of Kennemer promised to send five hundred men on this summer's expedition in Englaland if he becomes king. However, this is no longer relevant. We failed, and Sigurd 'Snake in the Eye' will not sacrifice more men. He will need to help his brothers in Englaland. You can rest easy.
qstr_{s3}^^{s4}|{s3}^^{s4}

qstr_{s10}_suggested_that|{s10} suggested that you talk to Ulf at his farmstead to convince him not to testify against you at The Assembly.
