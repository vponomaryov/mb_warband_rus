He is their champion, and he points to your army challenging your men to face him.^^Before you can speak, a boy runs out from the ranks. He isn't a veteran or the most capable of your troops, but he's certainly brave.^^Your warrior, your champion, advances to the enemy. They circle each other, studying each other's moves.

The enemy then draws his sword and charges with a cry.^^Your man quickly prepares himself and stands his ground, waiting with a spear rocking in his hand. Each champion batters the other's shield in an effort to hit home.^^Watching closely, you observe the first blood spilled, and then the last as your champion thrusts his spear through the mouth of his opponent.

The host before us is great, but they do not fight for their homes, but to plunder yours. They will fall! Ready your spears! Hold fast, and never yield! No man will yield his land or his glory to the cowards in the rabble before us. Fight! Die, but never yield! Never, never, never!'
menu_discurso_8|You inspect the troops and move among them. While speaking to them, you look each man in the eye, seeking to convey the significance of the moment:^^'Men, we stand before our enemy, ready for battle. Draw your sword! Take hold of your spear! This shield-wall is our home, so let us welcome our enemy! Let him come! Let the shield-walls strive one against the other! All that is needed is your own arm and your own heart. Within this shield-wall you shall stand, my brothers. I know that within the breast of each man here is a fire so bright that I say these walls protect our foes and not us! Our fate is glory! No man can take that unless you give it to him.'

They are so afraid, they piss their pants and shake like leaves, unable to hold their spears.  Men! I am with you, with my sword and my shield, bleeding and sweating, proud to stand shoulder to shoulder with such titans. Men, our fate awaits us. It's time for us to seize it!'
menu_discurso_11|You inspect the troops and move among them.  While speaking to them, you look each man in the eye, seeking to convey the significance of the moment:^^'Let us go out from this burning place into the open and stand up to our enemies. He who dies shall be with our god. He who dies not, his name will be honoured. I go first, and what I do, you do. May God be my witness, I will never leave you, my brothers and fellow knights!'.
menu_discurso_12|You inspect the troops and move among them. While speaking to them, you look each man in the eye, seeking to convey the significance of the moment:^^'The sun will set on our enemy this evening, but we shall shine as the rays of the sun on a spring day. You may be nervous and trembling now, but your shaking hands are nothing compared to theirs. They are but autumn leaves in the wind; we are the howling storm that will scatter them across the meadows, never to be seen again. Brandish your spears. Be the thunder that topples their tree. This land is ours -- these woods, these hills, these fields -- and so shall it be season after season, year after year, forever and ever!'
menu_doccinga_messenger|A farmer approaches, beating a squalid mule. He stops in front of you, takes a breath and shouts,^^'Sven Bull Neck is advancing on Doccinga with three ships! Thonkrik sent me to warn you. {s4} won't come; he has left us to luck!^I will give the news to the other jarls, but they are Danish and do not worry about Frisians. Please, we need your help.

menu_doccinga_messenger2|A messenger approaches, galloping. He stops in front of you, takes a breath and shouts:^^'Thonkrik seeks your presence in Doccinga, {playername}. He has captured a prisoner from Sven Bull Neck's Viking raiders in the recent battle.^He thinks you'll be interested in interrogating him and requests that you go to see him as soon as you can.Thonkrik  does not know how long he can hold the prisoner before the king or jarl claims him.'
menu_doccinga_c_assault|From a hill near Doccinga, you can see that the townspeople are fleeing. Some of the braver ones and a few of the king's men are trying to form a shield-wall at the beach, ready to defend their possessions or, in the worst case, to protect their loved ones' escape.^^Far off, in the sea, you distinguish three Viking warships. You cannot see them well from this far, but it isn't hard to imagine that they are full of warriors.^^Your mind cannot help but return to memories of that naval battle where Sven Bull Neck attacked your ship. Now, finally, the big Viking is again within a reach.^^From Doccinga, you notice that a man leaves, running. He looks like a warrior. Noticing you, he heads towards you...

menu_doccinga_c_assault2|As you approach the village, you see the queue of refugees fleeing Doccinga. They walk loaded with all their belongings and pull heavy wagons, so they move very slowly. If you don't stop the Vikings on the beach, all the refugees will die at their swords.
mno_choice_01_1e|Enter Doccinga.
menu_doccinga_victory|Blood drips from your hand to your elbow. Around you there is only death, and your ears are filled with the groans of the dying.^^The Vikings, defeated, have returned to the sea, leaving behind many dead and wounded, but the cost has been very high.^^Sven Bull Neck was not among the assailants, and that surprises you, as the boats were his. Where then is your hated enemy?^^Thonkrik's words resonate in your mind. Perhaps it is time to pay a visit to the jarl of Kennemer. He has some explanations to give.

menu_sven_lair|On the banks of a river, you distinguish a Viking fort. You've found the hideout of Sven!^It is a good place with a small port for ships, easy to defend. Behind the wall, between the houses, you can see some warriors. You cannot count them all without being seen, but it seems there a few dozen of them in there.^In the middle of the fort, you see some prisoners prepared for sale. Could your mother be among them?

You've decided to achieve your goals through diplomacy, to prevent casualties among your men.^^Now there's a new man in your party, an old friend, the Cantabrian, Bodo. Just outside Sven's hideout, he asks you to walk away with him. He wants to tell you what happened after Sven's attack on the Woden Ric.
mno_talk_to_bodo|Talk to Bodo.
menu_svenlair_victory|After a tough battle, your men have defeated the Vikings protecting the hideout. In one of the houses, you find three prisoners: two women and one man. The women are unknown to you, perhaps prisoners from other Viking raids, but the man is Bodo, the Cantabrian who traveled with you aboard the Woden Ric.^^Bodo joins your party. An old friend is back. He asks you to walk away with him. He wants to tell you what happened after Sven Bull Neck's attack on the Woden Ric. But first you need to decide what to do with Sven's hideout.

mno_destroy_it|Bah. I order my men to pillage and destroy it while I talk to Bodo.
menu_sven_lair_final|Fate is playing with you. First everything was pointing to your mother's death.

But, now that your mother is still alive and in the hands of your enemies, your priority is to find and rescue her.
mno_travel_s|Go.
menu_svenlair_victory_conquista|After a tough battle, your men have defeated the Vikings protecting the hideout. You need to decide what to do with it.

mno_talk_kingleader|Talk to the man who leads them.
menu_farmstead_sigurd3|You discover that the farm is a good place to spend a day away from the dangers and difficult decisions of the road. For a moment you dream that the farm is yours, you cultivate the fields, direct the slaves, and have each day bettered by the following. {s2}. You see yourself sitting on a bench at the door, watching the sunset or the dawn... Is this what you want? Or would it be too much of the same for you? No matter, you still have many things to do before thinking of a quiet life.^On the second day, one of your lookouts alerts you about armed men approaching. They are numerous and carry the banner of Sigurd 'Snake in the Eye'. Without having to give orders, your men pick up their weapons, put on their armor, and they run to the farm entrance to form their shield-wall.
mno_enter_to_battlefs|Begin the exchange.
menu_farmstead_sigurd4|You look at the men who came. They are many, maybe more than sixty, and they're well armed. A prisoner is pushed ahead with his head covered with a sack...
mno_choice_01_sigur|Enter.
menu_hablar_olvir|After a brutal combat, Ulf's farm is covered with corpses. Your men roam between the bodies, finishing off the wounded and taking everything that is of value. You look at Egil, who's cutting off the finger of a dying warrior to take a golden ring, then at Brunhild, who's watching with horror all the carnage, then at Reginhard, who's laughing sitting on a corpse. You, yourself do not know how you feel. Somebody said once that war changes people, that it is a voracious demon that devours your soul. Have you changed? Are you different?^^Your thoughts are broken when two of your soldiers bring before you Olvir. He's still alive, but not for long. The blood gushes from his side... unstoppable
mno_talk_to_olvir|Talk to Olvir.
menu_doccinga_prisonerjoined|While you travel, a man comes to your army. A few yards away, he puts down his weapons and shows his bare hands. You barely recognize him. It is the same man whom you interrogated in Doccinga, the Viking captain that you had let live.

menu_entregar_bodo|Two of Sigurd's men follow you to Bodo, who offers no resistance when you explain the situation. While Sigurd's men lead him away, he stops before you, looking at you with teary eyes. Brunhild and Reginhard don't seem happy with your choice.

It makes you a feared man if you make quick raids on settlements on the coast. It makes you a ruler if you conquer foreign lands. The Norseman say it will even bring you to the after-life.^^However, traveling on a ship is also dangerous. The sea is like an open grave beneath the hull, awaiting you and your men. The storms of winter will harm your ships, but calm weather isn't much better, because it forces your men to row. To avoid overtaxing the crew, it is customary to stop traveling at night and to rest on land.^^A ship is also a valuable possession. The owner should always keep an eye on it.^^Come back to this place as soon as you want to sail...

He is a tall man, robust and of proud bearing. When he arrives before your men, he shows open hands, so all can see that he is not armed. He seeks you with his eyes and walks towards you. One of your men stops him with his spear...

menu_aghatinos_conversacion|On one side of the road, a man is awaiting sitting on a big rock. He is thin, tall, and is dressed in poor clothing. He seems harmless enough. Calmly, the stranger waits until you come close to him. His eyes are searching through the faces of your men until they stop on you, then he gets up and walks to you.

menu_cueva_odin|The smell of the sea is pervasive in this area, and the rumble of the waves crash against the cliffs resonates in your head like thunder. There is a path, very narrow at the end of a beach, where you distinguish traces of men. It is a difficult way that you can only follow on your own, so you order your people to wait behind while you investigate.
mno_choice_doccingas|I need to recruit more men.
menu_orm_duel|You move from the farm to a clearing, where Ulf's thralls are preparing a ritual circle of stones that mark the boundary of the dueling area. Around you, all the men from the farm and your men form another circle to cheer you on.^^In front of you, Orm The Black warms his oversized muscles. He seems confident. Perhaps, given his spotless record of wins, he can't be said to be too confident. Your companions give you pats on the back, advice and wishes for good luck. All but Reginhard, who is pessimistic and says he will record the runes on your gravestone. Suddenly, Egil points toward Orm. The berserker has ceased to warm up his muscles. His body convulses uncontrollably, and his mouth foams white. Suddenly, he lifts his head and, looking at you with bloodshot eyes, shouts something unintelligible. He launches himself towards you like a viper, much more quickly than one would expect from such a large man...
mno_duel_orm|Jump to the fray.
menu_orm_duel_win|Orm the Black's corpse lies at your feet. Your arms are sore from blocking the brutality of his attacks, and your mind keeps replaying the more desperate moments of the duel.

menu_duel_rebelion_win|The duel is over. Your enemy lies on the ground, defeated by your skill with weapons. You hope that this serves as a warning to other potential rivals. Now your mission is to restore confidence and improve your army's morale.
menu_thething_messenger|A messenger approaches, beating his horse. He stops in front of you, takes a breath and shouts,^^'My King, Horik of Danmark, invites you to The Assembly being held near Ribe. Since it is going to be about your complaint with Sven Bull Neck and Sigurd Ragnarsson, you must go soon, or the judgement of The Assembly will go against you.'^^The messenger then kicks his mount and rides away.
mno_choice_01_1thing|Continue
menu_the_holmgang|A group of heavily armed men approach you. They are led by Harald Haraldsson, king's right hand, who reminds you of your promise at The Assembly. It is the hour of the holmgang and your opponent is already on Short Island. They surround your party and lead you to a nearby beach, where a gaunt old man waits in a small boat. You get in the boat, and two of Harald's men push it into the water. The old man, without a word to you, begins paddling toward an island on the horizon.
mno_choice_01_1duel|Continue.
menu_the_holmgang2|The water is gentle. The only sound you hear is that of the oars on the water, striking in a slow and deliberate rhythm. The old man is not so old, but wrinkles of a hard life at sea make him look like an elder. He wears a worn and salt-bleached tunic, and the skin of his hands look like hard leather. His eyes are blue and crystal clear and do not look directly at you even for a moment, but remain focused on the island. Up ahead awaits an opponent who once was a companion. The Assembly has decided that two go to Short Island, but only one return. The boat stops near a small beach, and after you get off, the old man paddles it a few tens of meters back into the ocean, where he stops and waits.
mno_choice_01_2duel|Duel.
menu_the_holmgang3|'Two went to the island, but only one returns.'^^You have been victorious, but at the cost of killing an old companion. In your mind, you remember the phrase that you heard so often from Reginhard: Gaed a wyrd swa hio scel!, Fate always goes as she must!^^The old man takes the boat back to where your warriors await in Danmark. When you arrive, they pick up their things and say nothing, aware of the gravity of the moment. Soon they are ready to go. Harald and his men have already left. It's time to look for The Assembly judge called Asbjorn in the mead hall of Ribe.
menu_the_thing|In a setting reminiscent of times past, when men lifted huge rocks to venerate their dead or glorify their gods, meets The Assembly. As you approach, you hear more clearly hundreds of voices, distinguish the tents, and smell the food from the merchant stands. The Assembly, or The Thing, is not just a meeting where issues are discussed and judgements are made but also an event where people around go to exchange news or sell their products.
mno_enter_thing|Approach.
mno_encounter_leavethething|Leave.
menu_partida_ribe_fleet|Finally, after you prepared yourself carefully for the long journey, the fleet rows out of Ribe, leaving Danmark behind to follow the Whale Route.
menu_partida_ribe_fleet2|By now the differences between Sven Bull Neck, protected by Jarl Sigurd, and Harald Haraldsson, protected by King Horik, are so clear that the fleet progresses divided in two, depending on who supports which commander.^^But it's not the time for worry. The sea brings wind and the freedom of the waves, and your ship is heading for Englaland where rivers carry silver and men get fame. And now you're closer than ever to Sven Bull Neck. You just wait for your chance to kill him and rescue your mother... Fate always rewards the patient.
menu_sven_attack_fleet|The journey from Ribe to Eoferwic or, as the Danish call it, Jorvik is three days with good weather, but with the slower knorrs, the trip will take a day or two more. The ships have spread out, but this is usual. When traveling with sail, the winds govern at will. The ships will reunite at their destination.^^A long trip like this requires a routine. Men take turns in the work of the boat, even at night, because the fleet never stops offshore. The smell of the crowded men is horrible, the water you drink and food you eat taste terrible, and it is always uncomfortable having to peer over the stern when you want to relieve yourself.^^Eventually, the rift between Harald and Sven becomes open. Each now meets separately with the captains who are faithful to him. Each part of the fleet proceeds separately. Harald has called you and the other captains to his boat for an emergency meeting. Apparently, one of the captains faithful to Sven Bull Neck has changed his allegiance to Harald and brings news.^^You look forward to the meeting as well. Maybe there is finally news of your mother.
mno_choice_mettingcap|Captains' meeting.
menu_playerflee_svenattack|Behind you fades the battle, the pitiful cries of the wounded, and the clash of swords. You leave behind Harald Haraldsson's army while Sven Bull Neck's men massacre them. Your mission now is go to Englaland to find Rathbarth Ragnarsson to tell him what happened and how Sven Bull Neck betrayed the king's men.
mno_choice_flee1|Flee.
menu_way_to_douaranenez|You gather the fleet and immediately the sailors cast off the boats and pull the halyards to raise the sails. The cloth is stirred, moved by the morning breeze, and the ships begin to move while the captains shout orders to the crew, which start to row. Moved by sail and oars, the fleet leaves the harbor to sail in open water.
menu_way_to_douaranenez2|You spend days at sea, uncomfortable on a boat with so many men, where there is no space for privacy and tranquillity. The smell of stale sweat, urine and sebum fills the air, even above the salty scent of the sea.^The climate is mild: no storms, no wind, despite the early appearance of fog. In fact, with so little wind, the fleet advances slowly, making the trip longer.^^Finally, from a nearby ship, one of the lookouts points to the horizon, and you can see Douar-an-Enez. In the bay of the village, there are more than 40 boats, many of them in the sea, lashed together in battle formation. One ship leaves the group and heads towards you...
mno_choice_d1|Join the parley.
menu_way_to_douaranenez3|Behind you, you hear discussion in the village. There seems to be dissension in the camp of the Astures. You hear swords and shouting.^^But none of that matters to you at the moment. In full sail, a Cantabrian ship takes you to where your boat awaits. You see, in the distance, your fleet maneuvering to confront their attackers. Gundinsalvo travels with you. He is serious, very serious, despite the buffoonery at the meeting. He looks to where the two fleets jockey for position with their oars. His face is fierce, that of a seasoned warrior who does not fear death. As soon as your ship arrives, it rows toward your fleet. It's time to take control...
mno_choice_douarb|To battle.
menu_way_to_douaranenez4|The sea has become a hell of fire, blood and death. Victory is yours, but many have been left behind, overcome by the edge of the sword, including the Cantabrian, Gundinsalvo.^^The naval battle was pure delirium of madness, but now your enemies flee. They are seeking to take refuge in Douar-an-Enez, but your warriors have pursued them, sparking a new battle in the little village. It is where you left Bodo, who attempts to bring together the Asturians and coordinate their efforts.^^It's your turn to join the fight...
mno_choice_douard|Disembark.
menu_way_to_douaranenez5|Douar-an-Enez is not the place it was when you first arrived. Now there are only fire and death... Its inhabitants have been turned over to torment, and you doubt that someday someone would dare repopulate this cursed place.^^You hear the plaintive cry of your own injured people, and men wander past you staring into the distance, still shocked by the battle. You remember how Bodo died in the fight and last time you shared with him. His mission failed with persistent inevitability. There is no longer a fleet from the kingdom of Asturias, only a few Cantabrians who have joined your cause after losing their own leader, Gundinsalvo. Now you are their leader. Some of your men dedicate themselves to finishing off the enemy and seizing their possessions.

mno_choice_douarb2|Let your men keep all the loot.
menu_bjorn_camp|On a hill, the Danish have built a small camp. Counting the number of tents that you can see, you figure that there are between 250 and 300 men. On one of the tents waves the banner of Bjorn, one of the most famous sons of Ragnar.^^A couple of men stop you, but they let you pass as soon as you identify yourself, as if they were advised of your arrival.

menu_nothingam_siege|Down in the distance, you see two Saxon and Angle camps surrounding Snotingaham. The camps are large, capable of holding thousands of men, and there are also patrols of warriors around the perimeter of the city, making sure that no one goes in or out. From this far away, you can just distinguish the silhouettes of Danish warriors as they patrol around the walls of the fortress. They are certainly in a compromising situation in terms of numbers, and the food is running out every day.

King Aethelred has divided his army in two: one led by himself and the other in the hands of his brother, young Aelfred. Each division takes one side of the ancient road, the Ridgeway. While the Vikings deploy, Aethelred decides that he must pray before the battle and refuses to budge until the service is complete. But the Danish approach quickly, their army also split in two...
menu_mega_battle_ashdown|The Saxon army has taken a vantage point on two hills, split in two. One of the hills is dominated by the troops of King Aethelred and the other by those of Aelfred. The Danish move quickly, more than expected, not stopping to rest or form up. This is something that Aethelred did not anticipate. He is still immersed in his prayers and has ordered not to be disturbed until finished. The Danish don't wait. They divide their own army into two in their advance. One division under the army leaders, Jarl Halfdan and King Bagsecg, heads straight for the hosts of Aethelred. The other, under five other jarls, moves in the direction of Aelfred. They start to seize the high ground on a hill above the Saxon positions. If they finish deploying, they will have the height advantage over their enemies...^^{s2} You have {reg10} troops fit for battle against their {reg11}.

menu_event_01_juicio|Two farmers, one very tall and lanky, the other low and stocky, were presented to you to discuss the ownership of a calf. Apparently their fields bordered each other and the tall farmer had a bull that impregnated a cow belonging to the other. The stocky farmer said the calf was his because it was his cow giving birth. The tall farmer claimed the calf to be his, being the offspring of his best bull, or at least get financial compensation.
mno_choice_01_1n|The owner of the cow is right. The calf is his, just like the cow is.
mno_choice_01_2n|The owner of the bull is right. The bull is his and the calf too.
mno_choice_01_3n|The owner of the cow keeps the calf and pays compensation to the owner of the bull.
mno_choice_01_4n|Neither is right. I'll slaughter the calf for its meat and give some to my men!
mno_choice_01_5n|Neither is right. Kill the calf and give the meat to both farmers!
menu_event_02_juicio|My {reg59?lady:lord}, we captured a murderer! This is the man who attacked one of our messengers in {s4}, who is lying seriously injured in bed. This doesn't show us in a good light, for the messenger was under your protection. However, the attacker has an interesting story, and he wishes to talk to you before his execution.^^The prisoner's story: 'My {reg59?lady:lord}, I would have never thought of attacking your messenger, but that man wished to sleep with my young daughter at night, and this offer was refused! However, he did not accept our answer, entered my house with three friends, and raped my dear daughter, laughingly telling me all the while that you would never believe the word of a commoner. A father must protect his only child!'
mno_choice_02_1n|The messenger was under my protection. You and your family will be executed at dawn.
mno_choice_02_2n|I will be reasonable: only you will be hanged.
mno_choice_02_3n|While the messenger was my servant, I would have done the same. You can go.
mno_choice_02_4n|I order the messenger to be hanged. No one should take advantage of their position.
menu_event_03_juicio|You summon two men to decide a dispute between them. One is a local leader, while the other is a farmer who rents the land of the leader.^^The man says his harvest was poor and cannot pay the rent, so the leader took the farmer's daughter to his own bed and as a servant in his house. The local leader is an influential figure within {s4}.
mno_choice_03_1n|Punish the farmer. He must pay rent to his lord.
mno_choice_03_2n|Punish the local leader. He has no right to take the farmer's daughter.
mno_choice_03_3n|Kill the noble and force the farmer to join your army for not paying his taxes.
mno_choice_03_4n|Compensate the noble yourself for the tribute and send the girl back.
menu_farmer_attack_lord|Not satisfied with your decision, the farmer pulls out his seax and pounces on the local leader, killing him before your men can do anything. Then he turns to you and says, 'This is justice, bastard!' Then with the same seax, he kills himself.
menu_event_04_juicio|One of your sworn men approaches you. He states his fears that, among the men, there is much dissatisfaction. Reason being that you are too placid and that there is too little gold and honour to be won in your service.
mno_choice_04_1n|Pay the men and give rings to them.
mno_choice_04_2n|Tell the men that they are released from their oaths if they are so stupid as to leave.
mno_choice_04_3n|Kill the man who approached you in front of the rest and state there shall be no more talk of sedition.
mno_choice_04_4n|Promise to change your leadership style, making sure to mention that the next big plunder is just round the corner.
menu_event_05_juicio|In {s4}, a man is brought before you. Your men inform you that he refuses to pay taxes to the kingdom, and therefore to you. The man insists that he will not pay taxes until the kingdom gives him back his boys, all of them killed in recent wars.
mno_choice_05_1n|This man has already lost enough. Forgive his taxes for life.
mno_choice_05_2n|Punish this man with death if he does not pay. You cannot allow the precedent.
mno_choice_05_3n|Pay the man a wergeld for the death of his boys and promise that their names will be remembered.
menu_nobody_want_paytax|Suddenly, the room where you exercise your legal authority is crowded with people who have lost sons to war, all demanding equal treatment.
menu_event_06_juicio|Two men come to you. Your men say they are ready to kill each other. One of them has cut some old oaks that were blocking traffic on the way, but they were actually within the borders of the estate of the other.^^'Those trees made the passage of my cart difficult!' exclaims the first one. 'We are only talking about trees. I do not understand this suit!'^^'Those trees were on my land, planted by my father, recently deceased,' shouts the other.
mno_choice_06_1n|The man who cut the trees must pay to the other in compensation.
mno_choice_06_2n|Trees hindered the way. They had to be cut.
mno_choice_06_3n|The man who cut the trees must pay to the other in compensation and to you as punishment.
menu_event_07_juicio|The harvest this year promises to be very bad, which means starvation for the winter. What should we do?
mno_choice_07_2n|Buy some wagons of grain from other places. It is the least I can do (1000 penings).
mno_choice_07_3n|I do not have enough money to buy food elsewhere.
mno_choice_07_4n|Serves them right for not tending to their crops carefully enough!
menu_event_08_juicio|One of the local leaders approaches you stating that he has an illegitimate son (whom he favours) who wishes to join your captains. You agree to meet the boy, as it would be unseemly to flat out reject a noble. When you meet the boy, however, it is clear that he is a homebody; certainly not warrior material. Faced with this plump, smiling youth do you:
mno_choice_08_1n|Allow him to join your captains.
mno_choice_08_2n|Ask for payment to grease the deal.
mno_choice_08_3n|Refuse. Only the best will serve as captains.
menu_event_09_juicio|Two proposals come before you one day. One is from a scholarly young priest called Osberh, who proposes building a church in {s4}. He promises to instruct you in new knowledge that will increase your intelligence in return.^^Another man, upon hearing this, pushes himself before you. He is a hulking, great-bearded warrior who overshadows Osberh completely. He suggests the funds would be better used on a training camp, and he promises to teach you a trick to increase your physical prowess.
mno_choice_09_1n|Choose Osberh's idea. You need to improve your intelligence.
mno_choice_09_2n|Choose the warrior. You need improve your strength.
mno_choice_09_3n|I have enough money to build both facilities (3000 penings).
mno_choice_9_4n|Hah! You have enough intelligence already not to fall for either one.
menu_event_10_juicio|A searing flash is seen across the night sky. There is much talk of omens the next day. Among the people of {s4} there is a general consensus that some act of sacrifice must be committed or some divine wrath shall befall the kingdom. The practise of the wickerman suddenly gains impetus, as it is near harvest time. They find an angelic girl, and she is treated as a living goddess until just before harvest. Suddenly you discover that the whole place has recovered traditions lost for centuries.
mno_choice_10_1n|Allow the sacrifice of the girl.
mno_choice_10_2n|Forbid the sacrifice and take the girl into your party for safety.
mno_choice_10_3n|This is no affair of yours.
menu_event_11_juicio|A runner arrives at your court, and after you allow it, starts to tell dire news. 'My {reg59?lady:lord}, a nearby village is in great danger! The populace has some kind of strange sickness, they can hardly move, sweat and vomit, and the local wise-woman has no cure for it. The local leader doesn't let anyone out at the moment and is expecting your orders!'
mno_choice_12_1n|Quarantine!, but I will pay to send the best area physicians to help! (500 penings)
mno_choice_12_2n|Quarantine! We will examine the survivors when the epidemic is over!
menu_event_12_juicio|Two nuns approach you. 'My {reg59?lady:lord}, we have a childbirth that is not going well! We tried everything we could, but it seems that the young lady is simply not suited for pregnancy. The girl is the daughter of a prominent local lord. What can we do?'
mno_choice_13_1n|Everybody, kneel down and start praying!
mno_choice_13_2n|Guards: Bring me the wise-woman from the village, NOW!
menu_event_13_juicio|One day, a loyal noble from nearby comes to you with a strange request. 'My lord, I am in a very bad situation. I spent all my money on proper equipment and troops, so that I can serve you well. However, my first daughter is about to marry, and I cannot send a proper dowry with her to the husband'.
mno_choice_14_1n|Take this small amount of silver for your faithful service (800 penings).
mno_choice_14_2n|I will help you now, but this is the last time (400 penings).
mno_choice_14_3n|No, you should have saved up the money up front!
menu_event_14_juicio|One day, a Christian missionary arrives at your doorstep. He is very enthusiastic. 'My {reg59?lady:lord}, I have splendid news! There is a merchant from Jerusalem in {s4} now, and he is willing to sell us a piece of the Holy Cross! I cannot believe that we have the opportunity to own such a famous relic! And this would help me so much to spread the word of Christ to the faithful!'
mno_choice_15_1n|I have seen many parts of the Holy Cross. We don't pay for fake relics!
mno_choice_15_2n|Sorry, but this place worships other gods. I won't waste my money.
mno_choice_15_3n|We cannot let this opportunity slip! (5000 penings)
menu_event_15_juicio|You are having a feast with your companions when a messenger comes to your attention, 'My {reg59?lady:lord}, there is a situation in {s4} that needs your counsel.' Excusing yourself, you step outside.^^A crowd has gathered there, arguing, but when you appear, it quickly falls silent. An elder bows to you and asks permission to speak, which you give. He speaks: 'My {reg59?lady:lord}, we need your wisdom. There are two women who claim to be the mother of this child, neither desist.'^Two women are presented. One is in fine clothes and the other in rags.
mno_choice_16_1n|Give the child to the poor woman.
mno_choice_16_2n|Give the child to the rich woman.
mno_choice_16_3n|Order to cut the child in half and give each half to one of the women.
menu_child_half_one|Then the woman in rags screams and says, 'No, please my {reg59?lady:lord}, let the other women have the child then.'^^Then the elder near you exclaims, 'So you are the rightful mother and this child belongs to you!'^^The other woman seems uneasy, 'I can give that child a better life than always living in poverty'.
mno_choice_16_1p|Give the child to the poor woman and punish the rich woman for lying.
mno_choice_16_2p|Give the child to the poor woman and the rich woman to the crowd.
mno_choice_16_3p|Give the child to the rich woman and poor woman to your men.
menu_event_16_juicio|Your advisor, streaked with dirt and sunburned, arrives after inspecting the harvest. 'My Lord, the harvest is poor this year. If you do not reduce taxes there will be starvation this winter.'
mno_choice_17_1n|Less taxes means releasing men from their oaths. Better an empty gut than a cut throat.
mno_choice_17_2n|Well, I will compensate for their shortfall from my purse (1000 penings).
menu_event_17_juicio|A peasant from a nearby village comes to you as a supplicant. He breathlessly reports that armed men have raided his farm, carrying off women, cattle and grain. He is spattered with blood and stinks of burned thatch.
mno_choice_18_1n|Hire watchmen to guard the area (300 penings).
mno_choice_18_2n|There is nothing to be done here. Away with you, mongrel!
mno_choice_18_3n|There will be war. Take this money and rebuild your village.
menu_event_18_juicio|A happy widow is accused of witchcraft after several oathmen sworn to your vassal report pain while relieving themselves. Your vassal backs their claim. You suspect he has the same complaint but knows better than to air it publicly.
mno_choice_19_1n|Banish the happy widow, exiling her to another place.
mno_choice_19_2n|Pay the witch and to have her help counteract the spread of Christianity.
mno_choice_19_3n|Where there's one, there's many! Kill anyone else reported for witchcraft.
menu_event_19_juicio|A missionary comes upon you and tells you of one of your villages where he was introducing God's grace. When he and his followers wanted to fell a ancient tree important to the pagans, most of the inhabitants took up arms and drove them out.
mno_choice_20_1n|This missionary is right: cut down this heretical tree.
mno_choice_20_2n|This missionary is wrong. Have him and his followers burn for the Gods.
mno_choice_20_3|This missionary is wrong. Have those Christians abandon this village in peace.
menu_event_20_juicio|A woman from a nearby village comes to you claiming that one of your men who died recently was her husband. She asks for assistance to take care of the remains.
mno_choice_22_1n|Give her monetary assistance and send for a priest.
mno_choice_22_2n|Do nothing. This isn't my problem.
mno_choice_22_3n|Unluckily, I do not have money for this.
menu_event_21_juicio|The most important local leader comes to you with a request. 'My {reg59?lady:lord}, would it not show your great mercy and honor to provide for those who have suffered while serving under you? We have dozens of maimed, lame and aged ex-warriors begging for coin in the streets and many families who have lost fathers and husbands in your battles. We need to reward and protect your loyal supporters, or else men might be hesitant in the future to be in your shield wall.
mno_choice_23_1n|It isn't my fault my men don't save their wealth for their families.
mno_choice_23_3n|We should support our veterans and their families (800 penings).
mno_choice_23_4n|Open my coffers and all families shall receive support from their {reg59?lady:lord} (2000 penings).
mno_choice_23_5n|I have no money for this unexpected expense.
menu_event_22_juicio|A seemingly straightforward case is brought before you. Yesterday, the accused man broke into the victim's house and removed large amounts of wealth. Many people saw him, and the missing items were discovered in his house. But the victim is an influential supporter of the previous lord, had actually served as a councillor and was known to be of doubtful loyalties. The accused, on the other hand, happens to be one of your most vocal supporters and has donated much money to your cause.
mno_choice_24_1n|Ignoring the evidence, you settle in your man's favor.
mno_choice_24_2n|The evidence is clear and the accused is found guilty.
mno_choice_24_3n|Both parties are in the wrong. You exile them and confiscate all material pertaining to the case.
